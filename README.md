# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple Python game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## How to run the program:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
    Navigate to the directory containing the game script using a terminal or command prompt.
    Run the game using the command: python filename.py (replace filename.py with the name of the game script).

## How to play the game:

    The game will prompt you to select a move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    Input your choice and press Enter.
    The game will then display the computer's choice and the result of the round.
    After the result is shown, you will be prompted to play another round or exit.

Note: The game is case-insensitive and trims whitespace, so "rock", "Rock ", " roCk" are all valid inputs.
Rules:

    Rock smashes Scissors
    Scissors cuts Paper
    Paper covers Rock

If both you and the computer choose the same move, it's a tie.

## Potential plans for future iterations:
    Graphical Interface: Create a GUI version of the game for a more engaging experience.
    Scorekeeping: Introduce a score system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties across multiple games.
